---

## Migration Notes

**No migration required** - These are new routes and do not affect existing functionality.

---

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Non-Blocking Items

1. **Subprocessor Page** - References to `/legal/subprocessors` page
   - Current: Links exist but page not yet created
   - Action: Create page in future PR or remove references
   - Impact: Low (can be addressed post-merge)

2. **Contact Page Verification** - DPA links to `/contact?subject=DPA+Request`
   - Current: Assumes contact page exists
   - Action: Verify route works correctly
   - Impact: Low (functional but unverified)

3. **Code Duplication** - Shared header/footer structure
   - Current: Duplicated across 4 files for clarity
   - Action: Could extract into shared components
   - Impact: None (purely structural optimization)

### Required Before Production

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: All legal content must be reviewed by qualified legal counsel before production deployment. The content is AI-generated and has not been reviewed by an attorney.

1. **Legal Review** - Have attorney review all pages
2. **Email Verification** - Confirm privacy@, legal@, security@ addresses exist
3. **Contact Route** - Test `/contact` page functionality
4. **Subprocessors Decision** - Create page or remove references
