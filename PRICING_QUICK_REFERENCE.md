## The Prices

```
FREE             PRO                    ENTERPRISE
$0               $9.99/month            Starting at $3,000/year
                 $99/year (2 months free)

                 Students: $7.99/mo
                 or $79/year (20% off)
```

---

## The Psychology

**Anchor-Hero-Decoy:**
- Enterprise ($3K+) = Anchor (makes Pro feel cheap)
- Pro ($9.99) = Hero ("Most Popular" badge)
- Free ($0) = Acquisition tool

**Annual Discount:**
- Say "2 months free" NOT "17% off"
- Psychology: Bonus > Discount

**Student Verification:**
- 90%+ students expect discounts
- 20% off = market standard
- SheerID = $0.25/verification

## The Math

**Individual Revenue:**
- 10,000 students × $9 avg = $90K MRR
- Annual value: $90K × 12 = $1.08M ARR

**Enterprise Revenue:**
- 50 universities × $5K avg = $250K ARR
- Monthly equivalent: $250K ÷ 12 = $20.8K MRR

**Total Target:**
- MRR: $110.8K
- ARR: $1.33M
- LTV: $90-150 (12-15 month lifetime)
- CAC: <$50 (target LTV/CAC = 3:1)

## The Decision Tree

**Should I reduce Free tier?**
→ If free-to-paid <2%, YES (reduce to 1 group)
→ If signups dropping, NO (keep 2 groups)

**Should I lower price?**
→ If conversion <1% after 30 days, YES (test $6.99)
→ If LTV/CAC >3:1, NO (keep $9.99)

**Should I increase annual discount?**
→ If <10% choose annual, YES (test 20-25% off)
→ If >70% choose annual, NO (reduce discount)

**Should I add 4th tier?**
→ If groups of 5+ want shared billing, YES (Team plan)
→ If 3 tiers converting well, NO (don't complicate)

## Remember

**Pricing is NOT:**
- Set-it-and-forget-it
- Based on costs alone
- About being cheapest

**Pricing IS:**
- Continuous optimization
- Based on value delivered
- About maximizing revenue
