### 2.1 Repository & Environment Setup

#### Create `ops/` Repository Structure
```
ops/
├── prompts/
│   ├── spec_writer_prompt.md
│   ├── reviewer_prompt.md
│   ├── marketing_prompt.md
│   └── brand_voice.md
├── scripts/
│   ├── spec_writer.py
│   ├── reviewer.py
│   ├── marketing_pack.py
│   └── changelog.py
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       ├── spec-writer.yml
│       ├── code-review.yml
│       ├── marketing.yml
│       ├── ship-staging.yml
│       └── ship-production.yml
└── README.md
```

#### Deployment Environments
- ✅ **Preview**: Auto-generated for each PR (Vercel)
- [ ] **Staging**: Connected to `release` branch
- ✅ **Production**: Connected to `main` branch

#### Branch Protection
- [ ] Protect `main` branch
  - Require CI checks
  - Require code review
  - Require Vercel preview success
- [ ] Create CODEOWNERS file
  - You and Henry review key directories
  - Bot can auto-approve minor changes

### 2.2 Project Management Integration

#### Option A: GitHub Issues (Quick Start)
- [ ] Create issue templates
- [ ] Define labels for bot triggers:
  - `needs-spec` → Spec writer bot
  - `dev-ready` → Ready for development
  - `needs-review` → Code reviewer bot
  - `ship` → Auto-merge to staging
  - `prod` → Merge to production
  - `marketing` → Marketing content bot

#### Option B: Linear (Recommended for Scale)
- [ ] Set up Linear workspace
- [ ] Create epics structure:
  - Website Relaunch
    - Home Page
    - Product Pages
    - Pricing
    - Blog & Content
    - SEO & Performance
    - Accessibility & Compliance
- [ ] Connect Linear ↔ GitHub
- [ ] Define status flow:
  - Backlog → Needs Spec → Spec Ready → In Dev → In Review → In QA → Ready to Ship → Done

### 2.3 Automation Bots

2. Generate changelog from git commits
3. Draft blog post announcement
4. Create social media posts
5. Post as new PR for review

#### Ship Bot
**Trigger**: PR labeled `ship`
**Function**: Auto-merge to staging, run smoke tests

## 📝 Notes & Considerations

### Integration with Henry
- [ ] Invite Henry to Linear workspace
- [ ] Add Henry to CODEOWNERS
- [ ] Coordinate on database merge timing
- [ ] Plan SendGrid setup when API key available

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with low-stakes features for bot-generated specs
- Always human review before production deploy
- Maintain rollback procedures
- Keep manual workflow as backup

### Future Expansion
- Consider adding bots for:
  - Bug triage and labeling
  - Dependency update PRs
  - Documentation updates
  - Customer support response drafts
